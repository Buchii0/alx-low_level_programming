 0. isupper. Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

    Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
    Returns 1 if c is uppercase
    Returns 0 otherwise

 1. isdigit. Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

    Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
    Returns 1 if c is a digit
    Returns 0 otherwise
    
 2. Collaboration is multiplication. Write a function that multiplies two integers.

 3. The numbers speak for themselves. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
    You can only use _putchar twice in your code

 4. I believe in numbers and signs. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language. Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

    Prototype: void print_line(int n);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
    The line should end with a \n
    If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe. Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

    Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
    The diagonal should end with a \n
    If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch. Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_square(int size);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where size is the size of the square
    If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
    Use the character # to print the square

 9. Fizz-Buzz
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

 10. Triangles. Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
    You can only use _putchar function to print
    Where size is the size of the triangle
    If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
    Use the character # to print the triangle
