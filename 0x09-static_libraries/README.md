 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libholberton.a containing all the functions listed below:

If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your holberton.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

 2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover:

    Why use libraries
    How they work
    How to create them
    How to use them.
